              L.A.U.R.A. is a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing the
              quality of life of the residents of South Central Los Angeles. We
              accomplish this by empowering youth, victim-survivors, and their
              families through civic awareness; facilitating community
              collaboration; and bringing a wide range of resources to the

            <p>
              “The organization “L.A.U.R.A” was formed in memory of Laura
              Sanchez. Laura was murdered on March 18, 2007 while parking her
              family van in front of her home. She was a wonderful, beautiful,
              loving mother of four and friend to many. She was an only child to
              Irene Cruz who was murdered the same way on a Thanksgiving night
              while waiting for Laura and her family on her mother’s front porch
              November 1998. Both innocent bystanders murdered by senseless
              “Drive By Shootings” in less than a decade In South L.A.”

            <h5>Our Vision</h5>

            <p>
              Our vision is to create a thriving, sustainable, safe, and clean
              community for all the residents of South Central Los Angeles.
              Through community collaboration, partnership development, and
              innovative initiatives, we hope to one day have multiple youth
              resource centers within in our community. About Our Founder: Adela
              Barajas and seven other siblings grew up in the South Central Los
              Angeles area and attended local schools. When her sister-in-law,
              Laura, was murdered in a drive-by shooting, she was compelled to
              become a part of the solution. She became a community advocate and
              is committed to finding ways to turn such tragedies into positive
              outcomes for her family and community. She has become a support
              system for Laura’s kids and other victims’ survivors in her
              community who are dealing with the cruel tragedy of losing a loved
              one.
